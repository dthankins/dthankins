          Dr. Hankins was born and raised along the coast of Mississippi.  Before entering medical school, he trained and practiced as a physical therapist.  His experience as a physical therapist led to an interest in sports related injuries and eventually to the decision to pursue subspecialty fellowship training in Musculoskeletal Imaging after completion of his Diagnostic Radiology residency.

          Radiologists are physicians who specialize in the interpretation of medical imaging, including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), MRI, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine. Musculoskeletal Radiology specializes in imaging of bones, joints and muscles. Image-guided procedures such as joint injections, epidural steroid injections and biopsies are also performed by Radiologists.

          <br><br>

          Dr. Hankins began his career in academic medicine teaching medical students and residents Musculoskeletal Imaging as well as Emergency Radiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He entered private practice in Montgomery, Alabama in 2015. Since joining Montgomery Radiology Associates, he has sought additional training in abdominal MRI and high resolution chest CT. <a href="Hankins-bio.html">Click here</a> to learn more about his training, experience and areas of interest.
